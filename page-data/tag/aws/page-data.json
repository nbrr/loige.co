I recently took this certification and I have to admit it was a little bit more challenging than I originally expected. I have been using a variety of AWS services professionally in the last 3 years, so I was optimistically expecting this practical experience to be enough. In reality, I had to spend some time to study and fill some gaps about important…","fields":{"slug":"aws-solution-architect-associate-exam-notes-tips"},"frontmatter":{"date":"21 October, 2018","title":"AWS Solution Architect Associate exam, my notes and tips","tags":["aws"],"header_img":{"publicURL":"/static/9f3b3348d4b78e8768f5f47770f9891d/aws-solution-architect-associate-exam-notes-tips.jpg"}}},{"timeToRead":6,"excerpt":"This article presents a quick tip that will help you deal with the content of files in S3 through the AWS command line in a much faster and simpler way. Did you ever want to simply print the content of a file in S3 from your command line and maybe pipe the output to another command? Or maybe, did you ever needed to pipe the standard output of a sequence of commands directly into a file in S3?

One of the requirements was to make the provisioning easy to reproduce over multiple environments, so we ended up playing a bit with Terraform, while obviously adopting OpenVPN for the VPN server. Another important requirement was to expose the OpenVPN web interface (also called Access Server) using an SSL, which I was expecting to be one of the most challenging things to automate, instead, it turned out to be…","fields":{"slug":"using-lets-encrypt-and-certbot-to-automate-the-creation-of-certificates-for-openvpn"},"frontmatter":{"date":"19 June, 2017","title":"Using Let’s Encrypt and Certbot to automate the creation of certificates for OpenVPN","tags":["ssl","web","terraform","security","aws"],"header_img":{"publicURL":"/static/45dfcbcf12ab7cac8a20f867207af385/using-lets-encrypt-and-certbot-to-automate-the-creation-of-certificates-for-openvpn-loige-icover-image.jpg"}}}],"tag":"aws"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
