I will also use htm, a library that can be easily integrated with Preact to define DOM elements in a very expressive and react-like way (like JSX), without having to use transpilers like Babel. Finally we will see how to dockerize a sample app built with this setup. This will make the app easy to share with co-workers and friends.

You probably know already that JavaScript does not support multiple return values natively, so this article will actually explore some ways to “simulate” this behavior. One of the most famous usages of this pattern I have seen recently is within React Hooks, but before delving into that, let’s see what I mean with “multiple return values” by…","fields":{"slug":"emerging-javascript-pattern-multiple-return-values"},"frontmatter":{"date":"11 November, 2018","title":"Emerging JavaScript pattern: multiple return values","tags":["javascript","node-js","design-patterns","react","lua","go"],"header_img":{"publicURL":"/static/72bee40a6cc87cb7a4bdb3a4590c088a/emerging-javascript-pattern-multiple-return-values.jpg"}}},{"timeToRead":3,"excerpt":"Last month (March 25th) I had the pleasure of delivering again my Universal JavaScript talk in a Codemotion Event, this time in Rome.\nAs expected it was a super interesting event and it gave me the chance to meet fantastic people, attend inspiring talks and refine my presentation.
