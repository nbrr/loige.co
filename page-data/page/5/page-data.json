Martin wrote the mail because he wanted to acknowledge me of his latest project: ORM Cheatsheet.  ORM Cheatsheet, as the name suggests, is nothing more than a reference website for those who struggles with some of the most common Php ORM libraries (it currently supports Doctrine2 and Doctrine, but it seems that Propel and Cake PHP…","fields":{"slug":"introducing-orm-cheatsheet"},"frontmatter":{"date":"11 April, 2014","title":"Introducing ORM Cheatsheet","tags":["php","doctrine","orm"],"header_img":{"publicURL":"/static/82efac82aeb5cf6a99c2cb1d881cab82/introducing-orm-cheatsheet.jpg"}}},{"timeToRead":1,"excerpt":"I have finally got my invitation to try the new text editor Atom.io. Atom is built with web technologies (node.js in it’s core) by the folks at GitHub and it’s somewhat very similar to the famous SublimeText.\nIn my opinion it seems very promising (even if it’s significantly slower than SublimeText), anyway I have to try it a lot more before shaping a serious opinion about it.

This trick is pretty useful in case you have lost (or you haven’t ever had) the password of your MySql root user. You just need to throw some commands at the console. Note that I am assuming you are using Ubuntu or some other Debian derivate. Otherwise the commands may change a bit (but not to much I believe).  1. Stop the mysql daemon 2. Disable the security checks The mysqld_safe command will essentially…","fields":{"slug":"reset-your-mysql-server-password"},"frontmatter":{"date":"30 March, 2014","title":"Reset your MySql server password","tags":["security","mysql","server"],"header_img":{"publicURL":"/static/8ecbcf4197f4bf2923cd233288a6171a/reset-your-mysql-server-password.png"}}},{"timeToRead":8,"excerpt":"In this article I will show you how to set up a stand alone command line application by using the Symfony Console component and Pimple.
